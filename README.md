## Queen'sU CISC 332 Database Management Final Project.

All codes are created by _Square-li (Xiao Li _
It's a basic php project for some exercise SQL queries and database design / management.

Support several functions such as:
To user:
1. Search and make reservations.*
2. Pick Up and Drop Off cars.
3. View history.
4. Give feedbacks.

To administrator:
1. Generate users monthly invoice.
2. Car management:
  2.1 Adding cars
  2.2 Check cars status
  2.3 List cars and resevations by parking locations / popularity
  2.4 List damaged cars
3. Find reservations by dates.

Problem so far:
  Ugly user interface. ( Can't really help with this XD )
  Admin login. 
  Some SQL requires fails. Could be solved recently.
